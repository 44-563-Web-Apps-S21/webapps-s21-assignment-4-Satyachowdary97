<h2>Antony and Cleopatra</h2>
<h3>SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.</h3>
<p>
<h5 class="name CLEOPATRA">CLEOPATRA</h5><p class="speech">
    Perchance! nay, and most like:<br>
    You must not stay here longer, your dismission<br>
    Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.<br>
    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?<br>
    Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,<br>
    Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine<br>
    Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame<br>
    When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!<br></p>

<h5 class="name MARK_ANTONY">MARK ANTONY</h5><p class="speech">
    Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch<br>
    Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.<br>
    Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike<br>
    Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life<br>
    Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair<br>
    Embracing<br>
    
    And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,<br>
    On pain of punishment, the world to weet<br>
    We stand up peerless.<br></p>

<h5 class="name CLEOPATRA">CLEOPATRA</h5><p class="speech">
    Excellent falsehood!<br>
    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?<br>
    I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony<br>
    Will be himself.<br></p>
