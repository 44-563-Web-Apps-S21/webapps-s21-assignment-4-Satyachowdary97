<h2>Antony and Cleopatra</h2>
<h3>SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.</h3>
<h4>PHILO:</h4> <p>Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO<br>Nay, but this dotage of our general's<br>
    O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,<br>
    That o'er the files and musters of the war<br>
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,<br>
    The office and devotion of their view<br>
    Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,<br>
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst<br>
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,<br>
    And is become the bellows and the fan<br>
    To cool a gipsy's lust.<br>

    Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her<br>
    
    Look, where they come:<br>
    Take but good note, and you shall see in him.<br>
    The triple pillar of the world transform'd<br>
    Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see. </p>

<p><h4>CLEOPATRA:</h4>  If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</p>

<p><h4>MARK ANTONY:</h4>    There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.</p>

<p><h4>CLEOPATRA:</h4>   I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.</p>

<p><h4>MARK ANTONY:</h4>    Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.<br>Enter an Attendant</p>
    
<p><h4>Attendant:</h4>  News, my good lord, from Rome.</p>

<p><h4>MARK ANTONY:</h4>    Grates me: the sum.</p>

<p><h4>CLEOPATRA:</h4>   Nay, hear them, Antony:<br>
    Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows<br>
    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent<br>
    His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;<br>
    Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;<br>
    Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'</p>

<p><h4>MARK ANTONY:</h4>    How, my love!</p>
