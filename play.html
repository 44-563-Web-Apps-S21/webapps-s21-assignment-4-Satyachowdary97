<h2>Antony and Cleopatra</h2>
<h3>SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.</h3>
<h4>PHILO:</h4> <p>Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO<br>Nay, but this dotage of our general's
    O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.
    Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her<br>
    
    Look, where they come:
    Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
    The triple pillar of the world transform'd
    Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see. </p>

<p><h4>CLEOPATRA:</h4>  If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</p>

<p><h4>MARK ANTONY:</h4>    There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.</p>

<p><h4>CLEOPATRA:</h4>   I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.</p>

<p><h4>MARK ANTONY:</h4>    Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.Enter an Attendant</p>
    
<p><h4>Attendant:</h4>  News, my good lord, from Rome.</p>

<p><h4>MARK ANTONY:</h4>    Grates me: the sum.</p>

<p><h4>CLEOPATRA:</h4>   Nay, hear them, Antony:
    Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
    His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
    Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
    Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'</p>

<p><h4>MARK ANTONY:</h4>    How, my love!</p>
