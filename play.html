<h1> Sai Satyanarayana Gullapalli presents</h1>
<h3>Antony and Cleopatra</h3>
<h4>SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.</h4>
<p>PHILO
    Nay, but this dotage of our general's
    O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.
    Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her
    
    Look, where they come:
    Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
    The triple pillar of the world transform'd
    Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.<br>

    CLEOPATRA
    If it be love indeed, tell me how much.<br>

    MARK ANTONY
    There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.<br>

    CLEOPATRA
    I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.<br>

    MARK ANTONY
    Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
    Enter an Attendant<br>
    
    Attendant
    News, my good lord, from Rome.<br>

    MARK ANTONY
    Grates me: the sum.<br>

    CLEOPATRA
    Nay, hear them, Antony:
    Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
    His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
    Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
    Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'<br>

    MARK ANTONY
    How, my love!<br>
